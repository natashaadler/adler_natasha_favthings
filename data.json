In grade 7 we had to create a cereal box branded and all, I created a mango crunch cereal and won the first-place prize. In grade 10 I even received the art award and had my art featured at the London Art Museum. Fast Forward to today and I’m in a Digital Art program. ",

This opinionated, long-haired, orange tabby is my family pet Rex, which we found out later means King in German, which is most suiting for him. He has a cat tree in the kitchen where he rules the house from and demands treats every hour. He has been through it all with us. He even lets me serenade him with songs.",

From classical training since I was six, to putting on musicals at home for my parents, to now creating my third album, it has been my saving grace. I believe music has a big impact on our world and can evoke feelings, unattainable without it. I’m grateful to share my voice to hopefully help others. I hope you like my unreleased video below. ",
